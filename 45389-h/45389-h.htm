      TWO YELLOW-BIRDS.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Lucy Tracy was
      a very little girl, her mother had a beautiful yellow bird. He was quite
      tame, and would come out of his cage, and sit upon Mrs. Tracy's plants,
      and then fly upon the breakfast table, and pick the crumbs from the white
      cloth, while Lucy and her lather and mother were eating their breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lucy had no brother or sister to eat breakfast with her; so that
      she enjoyed very much having Black-pate, as she called him, from the black
      tuft on his head. She could chatter to him, as if he were no older than
      herself. And she would often give him lumps of sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked very much to fly into a basin of water and flatter his wings, bob
      his head in and out, and spatter Lucy's face Then she would laugh and clap
      her would peck at, while she held them in her fingers, and he would do it
      again, as if to make her laugh the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would stand by her mother, as she filled his glass cups, one with
      hemp-seed and the other with water, and brush all the old seeds from the
      bottom of his cage; for birds love a clean cage, as well as little girls
      love a clean house.

      He was not a Canary bird; but one of the wild yellow birds, that fly about
      in the woods and fields. He did not seem to mourn his liberty, but
      appeared generally very happy in his wire house. His kind mistress took
      good care of him. She never trusted any one but herself to wash his cage
      or give him food. She knew poor birds often to suffer from hunger and
      thirst, by the neglect of those who are <i>told</i> to take care of them.
      She would often say to Lucy, "It is a hard thing, my little girl, to be
      shut up in a cage, as this poor bird is; therefore, we ought to do all we
      can to make him comfortable. It is very wicked to let little birds want
      seeds, or water, either to drink, or wash themselves in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But mother, if he don't like his cage, what makes him sing so sweetly,
      when he flies into it, after he has washed himself in the little basin you
      keep for him? That don't look as if he were unhappy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say that he was unhappy; but he has a feeling of confinement,
      when he flies against the wires of his cage, as if he wished to get out;
      just as you have when you find yourself shut up in a room, when <i>you</i>
      wish to get out. He sings to show his gratitude for his food, and while he
      is eating, feels quite as happy as when he is in his native woods; but
      after he has done, he wants to fly about just as you want to run. Soon he
      is hungry again; and then goes to his seeds to eat; and again sings his
      thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mother, if you think poor Black-pate is not happy, why don't you let
      him fly away, and go into the green woods again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Lucy, look out of the window, ana see if there be any green woods
      where he <i>can</i> fly?" Lucy ran to the window, but soon returned,
      exclaiming, "Oh dear! no, mother; the ground is all covered with snow; and
      the trees are all frost instead of leaves. Poor Black-pate! you are better
      where you are, for the cold snow would freeze your little, feet and you
      could find no seeds upon the frosty trees and bushes. Wait till spring
      comes; and then, mother, shan't you let him fly, if he chooses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I only bought him of the boys, who brought him here in the beginning
      of winter, to keep him until the warm spring comes, I told them I would
      take him at the price they named, if they would not catch any more, which
      they promised."
    </p>
    <p>
      In about a month from this time, the snow was all gone&mdash;the buds upon
      the trees began to swell, and some of them had burst into leaves. The sun
      was quite warm; and Lucy remembered her mother's promise to Black-pate.
      One morning, just before the sun rose. Mrs. Tracy called her little
      daughter to walk with her into the garden. "Come, Lucy, let us see if
      Black-pate would like to bid us good bye this fine morning." Mr. Tracy
      took the cage, and Mrs. Tracy and Lucy followed him into the garden; he
      hung it upon a tree, that was nearly covered with young leaves, and opened
      the door. The bird flew in and out several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast, Lucy sat down with her mother, in a parlor, that led to a
      piazza, looking into the garden, to study her lesson. Often she started up
      from her book and ran out, to see if Black-pate was still there. Her
      mother did not speak to her, for some time. He at times, peeked at the
      leaves, flew from bough to bough, sung some of its sweetest notes, but did
      not fly out of the garden. They left the cage upon the tree, and
      Black-pate at liberty to go or stay, just as he pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/012.jpg" alt="012s " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      At last she said, "Lucy; how many words can you spell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid not one; for I am thinking all the time about dear
      Black-pate, and how sad I shall he tomorrow morning, when I don't see him
      on the table. And I keep looking out, to see if he has got back to his
      cage. I am afraid, mother, I am selfish; for every time I look out and see
      him flying about, I feel sorry. Is not that selfish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, it certainly is; for it is preferring your own happiness to
      that of your little bird; which but a few weeks ago you begged me to set
      at liberty. I am glad you see it is selfish, for you will try not to
      indulge it, since you know it is wicked. Instead of thinking how sad <i>you</i>
      will be to-morrow morning, think how happy your <i>bird</i> will be,
      hopping about in the beautiful fresh air. And you may get up as early as
      you please, and go into the garden, and see if he will not give you a
      sweeter song than you ever heard in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, as soon as the day began to dawn, Lucy awoke, and called
      from her little bed. "Mother, do you think Black-pate is awake yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, but you may get up and see." So up jumped Lucy, and put on
      her clothes, and away she ran into the garden. She found the cage empty,
      but soon heard Black-pate, and some other birds, singing most briskly. She
      strewed some seeds and crumbs of bread upon the ground for them, and had
      great pleasure in running about and hearing them sing, till breakfast was
      ready. She then went into the house, and after breakfast she sat down to
      sew with her mother. She finished all the work that her mother required,
      and repeated her lesson without missing one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so good a girl, that in the afternoon her fond mother took her to
      ride with her, a few miles, to visit a friend, who had some children about
      her own age. They walked in the woods and saw and heard many little birds
      chirp and sing; and Lucy enjoyed very much a variety of plays with the
      children, and passed a part of the time very pleasantly in swinging.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>

      <img src="images/015.jpg" alt="015s " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      At night she, returned home by the light of a beautiful moon, and went to
      bed very happy. In the morning she went into the garden to hear Black-pate
      sing; but no Black-pate was there! At first she felt a little sad; but she
      remembered how happy the little birds were, that she had seen the day
      before; and she soon sent her sad feelings away A few days after this, a
      gentleman, a friend of her father, came to dine with them. As he was very
      fond of children, he talked a great deal with Lucy; and she told him the
      story of her bird. Black-pate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened very kindly to her and when she had finished, he said, "And
      so, my little girl, then your fine cage is quite empty and useless now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Lucy. "Well," said he, "I have some young birds that were
      born in a cage; and they will not be unhappy to live in one, if they are
      taken good care of; for they have never known any other home. Now if your
      mother is willing, and you would like it, I will send you one to-morrow
      morning, to put into your empty cage. And I dare say you will never forget
      to feed him, and give him fresh water to drink and wash in every morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tracy was quite willing; and Lucy promised she would not forget.&mdash;The
      next morning the gentleman sent the bird; for he always remembered his
      promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/017.jpg" alt="017s " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      This bird was not so handsome as Black-pate; his color was not as
      brilliant, nor his neck so long and graceful; but he sung very sweetly;
      and Lucy soon found that she loved him quite as well as she had ever loved
      Black-pate Though only six years old, she never once forgot to give him
      fresh seeds and water, and to clean his cage every morning. She was so
      small that she could not take down the cage from the sunny window, where
      it hung, nor put it back, after she had cleaned it; but her father was so
      much pleased with her attention to her little favorite, that he was always
      ready to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly two years, Lucy thought that her bird grew handsomer and sang
      more sweetly every day. She used to go to school in the morning, and when
      she came home, would often bring flowers to dress his cage with, or
      chickweed, and the long seed vessels of the plantain, which little birds
      love very much; and he always repaid her with a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the third spring, he began to droop and look sick; he left off
      singing, and almost left off eating. He would sit on his roost for a long
      time, hanging his head, as if he had not strength to hold it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grieved Lucy very much to see him so. She put saffron into the water;
      buds of saffron about his cage; gave him lump? of nice sugar; and spread,
      every morning, large branches cf fresh chick-weed over his cage; but all
      to no purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, poor little Pet, for that was the name she gave him, looked
      more sick than ever. She changed the water and the seeds; though the seeds
      she had put in fresh the day before, had not been touched. She dressed his
      case with all the flowers she could find in the month of May, and then
      went to school with a heavy heart. At noon she came home, and her dear Pet
      lay on his hack upon the bottom of his cage. His sufferings were all
      ended. The little bird was dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>

      <img src="images/019.jpg" alt="019s " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Poor Lucy wept bitterly; this was the heaviest affliction she had ever
      known. She laid down upon her mother's bed, and sobbed aloud. Mrs. Tracy
      knew that the sorrows of children are not last ing, though they are severe
      for the time. She therefore did not, at first, think it best to endeavor
      to restrain her tears; but she found that if not checked, she would make
      herself ill. She would not eat any dinner; and she was unfit to go to
      school in the afternoon. Her mother, at length, said, "My dear child, you
      must not give way thus to your grief for the loss of a bird. I know that
      you loved Pet very much, and that he gave you a great deal of pleasure;
      but you must remember, that sorrow for the death of a bird ought not to
      unfit you for every thing. Now, by thus crying, you have been obliged to
      stay from school, and have lost several hours work upon the little frock
      you were making for your aunt; besides making your head ache so much, that
      you cannot study your lesson this evening. I feel very much for your
      grief; but you are old enough to understand that all sorrow which prevents
      us from doing our duty, is wrong&mdash;it is selfish While you were laying
      upon the bed crying and sobbing, do you think your father and I could
      enjoy our dinner? I assure you we did not. And your lather went to the
      store with a very sad countenance. I hope when he comes home, you will
      meet him with a smiling face, and let him see, that, though you loved your
      bird very much, you love him more. And I hope, my little girl, you will
      learn a lesson, from this first sorrow, which will be of use to you all
      your life, viz. not to feel so strong an attachment to any object, that
      the loss of it will unfit you to do any thing that it is your duty to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucy was in general a good girl: and she loved her parents very much, for
      they were always kind to her; though they never indulged her in any thing
      they thought wrong. She attended to what her mother said, and was sorry
      she had grieved them so much. She got up from the bed, washed her face and
      eyes in cold water, combed her hair smooth, and when her father came home,
      he found her sewing with her mother She was a little sad; but she cried no
      more, and answered very pleasantly when any one spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend of her father passed the evening with them. He saw that Lucy was
      not so lively as usual, and inquired the cause. He told her he would paint
      her a likeness of her little bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that the bird was not handsome; but he was a very sweet
      songster. And we trust all our little readers know, that beauty of person
      alone will never recommend either little birds or little girls, to the
      affections of their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lucy became a woman, though she met with many heavy afflictions, she
      always kept in mind, that "all sorrow which makes us neglect our duty to
      our fellow-beings, is selfish, and of course wrong."

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ome, Maria, my
      dear, said her mamma, let us take a walk, and I will show you some pretty
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria was quite pleased to hear this, and ran to fetch her bonnet and
      cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mamma then took her by the hand, and led her out at the door, and then
      out at the gate, and then they came into the road; and as they went to the
      place where her mamma meant to show her little girl the fine things, they
      saw a number of sheep and lambs sporting in the open fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon came to the place, and there they saw very fine flowers, which
      smelled so sweetly that little Maria felt quite happy with the sights and
      scents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, my dear," said the lady to her little girl, "this is a rose; what a
      fine pink hue it has got! Smell it my dear, for I am sure that you will
      like it;&mdash;did you ever smell any thing so sweet?&mdash;There is a bud
      of the rose: see what fine soft moss grows on it, and how close it is
      wrapped round with green leaves to guard it whilst it is young and
      tender."

    <p>
      "That, Maria, is a stalk; it is like a little bush of red flowers, of a
      very nice scent. It is so fine a one, it looks like a young tree. There is
      a wall flower: some like the smell of them very much, but some think they
      are too strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a pink; it is very sweet to smell of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a heart's ease: it is a very pretty little flower. What a fine
      purple color on that leaf; it is like velvet; but it has no scent."

      "Neither has the blue-bell, which you see there, though it looks very
      pretty."

      Maria's mamma shewed her a great many more flowers, and told her the names
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! what flower is that, mamma," said little Maria, pointing with her
      finger to a very tall and large flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, my dear, is a sun-flower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! how large it is," said Maria, "it is like a sun in this fine Garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mamma then took her all over the garden, and Maria asked her what the
      name of this thing, and what the name of that thing was all the time they
      were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mamma then picked her little girl a very pretty bunch of flowers,
      which Maria took home with great care, and then put them in one of the
      vases which was in the parlor, and put water to them, to keep them alive
      as long as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mamma took home a large bunch for herself, to put into the large China
      jar, to make the room look lively, and smell sweet with the scent of it,
      and a very fine flower-pot it was.
